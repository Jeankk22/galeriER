        <h2>About the Me</h2>
        <p>This website was created by Jean De La Paix Kwizera Katabarwa.
           The purpose of this website is to showcase art as a person fascinated 
           with landscapes, painting or interesting places in generall.
           I concider myself an artist eversince a kid when I used to draw but even though 
           I put a stop to that part of my life. i have decided to display my love for art 
           in form of images.
